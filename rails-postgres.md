# Catalyze Rails - PostgreSQL Guide


## Introduction
This guide will walk you through an end-to-end roll-out of a Ruby on Rails app with logging, environment variables and connection to a PostgreSQL database hosted on the Catalyze platform. We assume that you already have a contract in place with us as well as a signed BAA. Please contact us if you need help or sign up for a [Free Trial][4].

You will start by creating your environment and linking your local app to our internal git repositories as outlined in our [Onboarding Guide][1]. Then you will add logging, environment variables and a PostgreSQL database to your app. Lastly you will commit your changes and push your app to the secure Catalyze platform.
